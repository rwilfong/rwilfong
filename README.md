- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Rose. I'm a graduate student at Purdue University where I study biological sciences. Through recent involvements I've become deeply interested in computer science and machine learning. 
- Iâ€™m expanding my knowledge in data science and computer science and seeing how these fields can impact biology, pharmaceutical sciences, and public health.
